A vibrant biome with a thick and hazy atmosphere.

Thick, slow moving fog rolls over the meadow in waves. Fog density changes dynamically, sometimes you can see 20 meters, other times only silhouettes.

Everything here is discovered in moments, not vistas.

Vegetation hangs upside-down, tethered to the ground. Islands of grass and gas float through the mist, stalks rise up dozens of meters above the ground, seed pods release, rise into the air and pop, spreading their seed.

The clouds are a pasty white, with the vibrant green grass cutting through it. Anything that matters is a deep crimson - vines, seeds, predators.

The most valuable plants lie at the top of the biome, requiring vertical parkour.
