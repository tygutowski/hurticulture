Your crew of reconaissance robots has crash-landed on a hostile world. The only way off this cyberpunk corpo wasteland is to earn it, one credit at a time.

Grow, gather, and scavenge to fund your escape. Spend your hard-won credits on new plants, defenses, upgrades, and weapons, and eventually buy the ship that gets you off this rock.

Daylight is for farming and foraging.  
Nightfall is when the wildlife hunts. Get home, hold the line, and see another sunrise.

Explore diverse biomes, discover strange flora, and try to survive against the locals.
