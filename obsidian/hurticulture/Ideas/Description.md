Yellow area is easy, orange is medium, and red is difficult.
The main difference is the type of biomes that spawn.


The player starts at the blue dot in the center and survives the first few days in the yellow area. They go to objective 1 and see objective 3, which is too far to reach in one day.
Their primary objective is to reach objective 2, which will unlock the ability to reach objective 3.
Objective 4 is far away, and in a difficult area, but completing objective 3 will unlock objective 4.

Additional items must be purchased to reach objective 4.
