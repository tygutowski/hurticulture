**visual description:** Ovular reddish-purple spiked fruit with yellow ends. Engorges to a swollen deep purple. Like a more dangerous dragonfruit.

**gameplay description:** This fruit begins to swell when picked up. Moving with the fruit further accelerates the swelling, and standing still causes the plant to slowly shrink. If the fruit becomes too large, it will create a large explosion, damaging the player and anything nearby. The fruit can be thrown to friends, which will not contribute to it swelling. If the fruit is thrown at the ground, it will swell considerably, and if its already swollen, it will explode.
