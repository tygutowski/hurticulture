#enemy
**danger:** #danger-medium
**rarity:** #rarity-rare
**fear:** #fear-none
**spawn prerequisite:** Two players must be near each other
**attributes:** 
**visual description:** A large, dark, ragged man, draped with leaves and tattered cloth. He towers over the player, and can pick them up with a single hand.

**encounter:** The Tollman will scout for players by roaming around the map. 

**attack:** If two players are nearby, he grabs one by the head and carries them to the other player. The Tollman indicates that he wants to trade for the player. The player must drop items on the ground to trade with the Tollman. If the player refuses to trade, or the value of their goods are too little, the Tollman crushes the victim's head and disappears shortly after. If the trade is completed, he will swiftly take the items, drop the player, and disappear.

**weakness:** Do not approach.
