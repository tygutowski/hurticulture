**visual description:** A large toothy fish with large milky eyes and two stumpy legs. From its head sprouts a long piece of cartilage with a bright light on the end.

**encounter:** The Angler will spawn and roam around aimlessly in the dark, luring its prey with light.

**weakness:** Do not approach.
