#enemy
**danger:** #danger-high
**rarity:** #rarity-uncommon
**fear:** #fear-medium
**spawn prerequisite:** a scarecrow must be placed on the map
**attributes:** #mimic
**visual description:** A mimic that looks nearly identical to the scarecrow deployable. The only noticeable difference is the lack of a hat.

**encounter:** The Scarecrow only appears once a player has placed a scarecrow deployable. It will implant itself in the middle of a crop field and wait until a player is nearby to attack. The crops must be tall for the scarecrow to spawn.

**attack:** The Scarecrow will rapidly chase the player on all fours to the edge of the tilled field, refusing to leave the edges. Once the player gets off the field, it will skulk back into the crops, despawning.

**weakness:** The Scarecrow will run in fear if threatened with an explosion or a flashbang.
